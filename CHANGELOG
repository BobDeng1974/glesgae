CHANGELOG:

12th October 2011
Created HashString class based on standard djb2 algo.
Created INVALID constant.
Lots of memory errors fixed via use of extensive Valgrinding.
While the engine still has issues on my netbook with rendering anything, it's at least fully cleaning up after itself - minus some lazy Vbo management which needs dealt with anyway.
Next changeset should hopefully be either another platform ( Win32, Android or iOS ) or OpenAL for audio.

10th October 2011
Split up RenderContexts into:
RenderPlatform - Platform specific bits ( initialise, shutdown, refresh, create contexts, windows, etc.. )
RenderContext - Actual drawing bits ( initialise context, shutdown, refresh, drawMesh, getState )
RenderTarget - What we're drawing to ( screen, buffer - with optional depth, colour and stencil parts )
RenderState - Store state for the rendering API ( IE: buffers GL State to keep actual state switches to a minimum )

Resource - made a sort-of boost shared_ptr like thing... we can get away with using this as a dual purpose object due to the Id parts - if it's invalid, it's an untracked resource.
Need to add functionality to track untracked resources later if need be.

Lots of things still broken and incomplete, though the FixedFunctionGlVboRenderer works with the GLES1State through the GLXRenderContext.
Need to add functionality to be able to configure this at runtime, but seeing as I'm well over due with this.. I'm committing now.. it renders, so.. yay!
